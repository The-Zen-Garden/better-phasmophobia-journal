### Welcome back,
It appears some hunters are struggling to navigate between clues and community insight when gauging ghost behavior. We've attempted to bridge that gap by providing an [alternative journal](https://better-phasmophobia-journal.netlify.app/) to ensure ghosts are tracked as optimally as possible.

## Features
- Auto-filter ghosts based on select ghost evidence
- Extensive ghost info available (Strengths, Weaknesses, Abilities, Behavior, Strategies)
- Manual exclusion for indiviual ghosts


###### Built with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/).
